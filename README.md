If you go to the Program.cs file, you will see an example of what inheritance is.
Inheritance is when you create a base class and a derived class that has all the attributes from the base class.
Everything that base class has, depending on access modifiers, the derived class can use.
In this case Mario is the base class and Luigi, his brother, is the derived class because Luigi has everything Mario has.
Except Luigi is better in this case.
